Terms and Conditions
--------------------

You may also redistribute the contents of this package as a part of your own Unity Package, even
commercial one, provided that you clearly state that your package is using NGUI, and conditional
on you not altering the contents of the NGUI package other than removing the files you don't need.

The contents of this package may not be used in commercial products outside of those distributed
as Unity Packages.

Due to how this package was set up it is missing some of NGUI's editing tools. If you decide that NGUI is 
what you want to use for your project, all your UIs will be transferrable to the full version of NGUI -- 
no data will be lost, provided you will follow these simple upgrade steps:

While INSIDE of Unity:
- Create a new temporary scene (File -> New Scene)
- Delete the entire NGUI folder (first make sure your data is outside of it!)
- Import the unitypackage containing the full version of NGUI.

All your scripts, prefabs, scenes, etc will retain their references to NGUI components.
