	/// <summary>
	/// The idea is that here is a bunch of the basics on using SQLite
	/// Nothing is some advanced course on doing joins and unions and trying to make your infinitely normalized schema work
	/// SQLite is simple.  Very simple.  
	/// Pros:
	/// - Very simple to use
	/// - Very small memory footprint
	/// 
	/// Cons:
	/// - It is a flat file database.  You can change the settings to make it run completely in memory, which will make it even
	/// faster; however, you cannot have separate threads interact with it -ever-, so if you plan on using SQLite for any sort
	/// of multiplayer game and want different Unity instances to interact/read data... they absolutely cannot.
	/// - Doesn't offer as many bells and whistles as other DB systems
	/// - It is awfully slow.  I mean dreadfully slow.  I know "slow" is a relative term, but unless the DB is all in memory, every
	/// time you do a write/delete/update/replace, it has to write to a physical file - since SQLite is just a file based DB.
	/// If you ever do a write and then need to read it shortly after, like .5 to 1 second after... there's a chance it hasn't been
	/// updated yet... and this is local.  So, just make sure you use a coroutine or whatever to make sure data is written before
	/// using it.
	/// 
	/// SQLite is nice for small games, high scores, simple saved, etc.  It is not very secure and not very fast, but it's cheap,
	/// simple, and useful at times.
	/// 
	/// Here are some starting tools and information.  Go explore.
