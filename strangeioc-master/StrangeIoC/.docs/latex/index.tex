Strange\-Io\-C is a super-\/lightweight and highly extensible Inversion-\/of-\/\-Control (Io\-C) framework, written specifically for C\# and Unity. We’ve validated Strange on web and standalone, i\-O\-S and Android. It contains the following features, most of which are optional\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A core binding framework that pretty much lets you bind one or more of anything to one or more of anything else. 
\item Dependency Injection 
\item Two types of shared event bus 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Event\-Dispatcher (the default) is a simple, but non-\/type-\/safe, dispatching bus 
\item Signals, which offer type-\/safety 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Mono\-Behaviour mediation 
\item Optional M\-V\-C\-S (Model/\-View/\-Controller/\-Service) structure 
\item Multiple contexts 
\item Don’t see what you need? The core binding framework is simple to extend. Build new Binders like\-: 
\end{DoxyItemize}In addition to organizing your project into a sensible structure, Strange offers the following benefits\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Designed to play well with Unity3\-D. Also designed to play well without it. 
\item Separate Unity\-Engine code from the rest of your app, improving portability and unit testability. 
\item A common event bus makes information flow easy and highly decoupled. 
\item The extensible binder really is amazing (a friend used to tell me “it’s good to like your own cookin’!”). The number of things you can accomplish with the tiny core framework would justify Strange all on its own. 
\item Multiple contexts allow you to “bootstrap” subcomponents so they operate fine either on their own or in-\/app. This can hugely speed up your development process and allow developers to work in isolation, then integrate in later stages of development.
